// Get the elements to be worked with
let removeButtons = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.removeButton'));

// Add event listener to 'add' button
// We may also need to add event listeners to all 'removeButtons'
// AND update the let removeButtons variable

// Function() that will put the tag in the box
// Should there be a helper method to create and return a tag element?
// Maybe even a js class?

// Function() that will remove a tag from a box if said tag's removeButton is clicked
